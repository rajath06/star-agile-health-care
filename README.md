# Medicure â€“ CI/CD Pipeline and Infrastructure Automation

## Project Overview
Medicure is a super specialty hospital chain based in New York, USA, owned and managed by Global Health Limited. Medicure provides world-class treatments and surgeries, including Heart, Liver, Kidney transplants, and is recognized as the first robotic surgery center. The organization aims to centrally manage all doctor and patient data across its multiple hospital locations using a dedicated microservice.

### Problem Statement
Medicure has developed a microservice to handle centralized data management, but they are facing challenges due to increasing application and infrastructure complexity:
- Building complex builds is difficult.
- Manual testing of various components and modules.
- Incremental builds are hard to manage, test, and deploy.
- Manual infrastructure creation and configuration is time-consuming.
- Continuous manual monitoring of the application is challenging.

### Solution
To overcome these issues, Medicure plans to automate its application build and deployment process using DevOps practices and tools. They are open to using **AWS, Azure, or GCP** as their primary cloud provider and will leverage **Kubernetes** for container orchestration to manage container deployments, scaling, and descaling.

## Project Goals
- Automate complex builds and deployments.
- Enable continuous integration, testing, and deployment.
- Provision infrastructure as code.
- Manage and scale container deployments efficiently.
- Reduce manual efforts and accelerate feedback loops.
- Ensure high-quality, reliable, and frequent production releases.

## Tools & Technologies Used
| Tool           | Purpose                                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Git**        | Version control system for tracking code changes                         |
| **Jenkins**    | Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment automation              |
| **Docker**     | Containerization of microservices for consistent deployments             |
| **Ansible**    | Configuration management and automated environment setup                 |
| **Terraform**  | Infrastructure as code for cloud resource provisioning                   |
| **Kubernetes** | Orchestration and scaling of containerized applications                  |

## Key Benefits
- **Automated Infrastructure Creation**: Terraform used for provisioning infrastructure on AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- **Continuous Build and Deployment**: Jenkins automates the complete pipeline with integrated testing.
- **Containerization**: Docker enables easy packaging and deployment of services.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manages container deployments, scaling, and reliability.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible provides environment consistency across all stages.
- **Monitoring and Optimization**: Scalable infrastructure with automated scaling using Kubernetes.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate monitoring with **Prometheus and Grafana**.
- Implement automated rollback strategies for failed deployments.
- Add automated notifications (Slack, Email) for build and deployment status.
- Adopt canary or blue-green deployment strategies.
